Values refer exclusively to roundwood, excluding fuelwood and other wood products.
Values are broken down by:

| Column       | Description                                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

| ncon_prd  | Volume of domestically produced non-coniferous roundwood | 
| con_imp | Volume of imported coniferous roundwood (EU and non-EU combined)  | 
| ncon_imp| Volume of imported non-coniferous roundwood (EU and non-EU combined)|
| con_exp | Volume of exported coniferous roundwood (EU and non-EU combined)  |
